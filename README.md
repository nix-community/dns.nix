_A Nix DSL for defining DNS zones_

This repository provides:

1. NixOS-style module definitions that describe DNS zones and records in them.
2. A DSL that simplifies describing your DNS zones.


## An example of a zone

```nix
with dns.lib.combinators; {
  SOA = {  # Human readable names for fields
    nameServer = "ns.test.com.";
    adminEmail = "admin@test.com";  # Email address with a real `@`!
    serial = 2019030800;
    # Sane defaults for the remaining ones
  };

  NS = [  # A zone consists of lists of records grouped by type
    "ns.test.com."
    "ns2.test.com."
  ];

  A = [
    { address = "203.0.113.1"; }  # Generic A record
    { address = "203.0.113.2"; ttl = 60 * 60; }  # Generic A with TTL
    (a "203.0.113.3")  # Simple a record created with the `a` combinator
    (ttl (60 * 60) (a "203.0.113.4"))  # Equivalent to the second one
  ];

  AAAA = [
    "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab"  # For simple records you can use a plain string
  ];

  CAA = letsEncrypt "admin@example.com";  # Common template combinators included

  MX = mx.google;  # G Suite mail servers;

  TXT = [
    (with spf; strict [google])  # SPF: only allow gmail
  ];

  subdomains = {
    www.A = [ "203.0.114.1" ];

    staging = delegateTo [  # Another shortcut combinator
      "ns1.another.com."
      "ns2.another.com."
    ];
  };
}
```

You can build an example zone in `example.nix` by running
`nix build -f ./example.nix` or `nix-build ./example.nix`.


## Why?

* The DNS zone syntax is crazy. Nix is nice and structured.
* Having the full power of a Turing-complete functional language
  (`let`, `if`, `map` and other things you are used to).
* All kinds of shortcuts and useful combinators.
* Strong typing provded by the NixOS module system.
* Modularity: records defined in different modules get magically merged.


## Use


### Importing

There are two ways to import `dns.nix`.

#### As a flake

Add it as an input to your flake:

```nix
# flake.nix

{
  inputs = {
    # ...

    dns = {
      url = "github:kirelagin/dns.nix";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";  # (optionally)
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, dns }: {
    # Most functions from `dns.nix` are available in `dns.lib`.
    # Functions that require `stdenv` (e.g. `writeZone`) are in
    # `dns.util.<system>`.
    # ...
  };
}
```

#### Importing directly (legacy)

Always get the latest version from GitHub:

```nix
let
  dns = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/kirelagin/dns.nix/archive/master.zip");
in {
  # ...
}
```

To make your setup more reproducible, you should pin the version used by specifying
a commit hash or using a submodule. This is all a little clumsy and nowadays it
is probably best to simply switch to flakes.

### Basic use
Define a zone content:

```nix
# example.com.nix

{ dns }:

with dns.lib.combinators;

{
  SOA = {
    nameServer = "ns1";
    adminEmail = "admin@example.com";
    serial = 2019030800;
  };
  useOrigin = false; # default value, see comment below.
  NS = [
    "ns1.example.com."
    "ns2.example.com."
  ];

  A = [ "203.0.113.1" ];
  AAAA = [ "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab" ];

  subdomains = rec {
    foobar = host "203.0.113.2" "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89bb";

    ns1 = foobar;
    ns2 = host "203.0.113.3" "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89cc";
  };
}
```

Then use `toString` to generate as a string.

``` nix
{ dns }:

  zoneAsString = dns.lib.toString "example.com" (import ./example.com.nix { inherit dns; });
```


If `useOrigin=false`, the default value, serialization will use fully qualified name.
For instance, `A = [ "203.0.113.1" ]`will be serialized as `example.com. A 203.0.113.1`.

If `useOrigin=true`, `toString` adds `$ORIGIN example.com.` and use `@` as domain name.
`A = [ "203.0.113.1" ]`will be then serialized as 

``` dns-zone
$ORIGIN example.com.
@ A 203.0.113.1
```

### In your NixOS configuration

_There is a chance that in the future we will either integrate this into
existing NixOS modules for different DNS servers, or will provide a separate
NixOS module that will configure DNS servers for you._

These example assume `nsd`, but it should be pretty much the same for other daemons.

When your system is defined as a flake:

```nix

{

# Add `dns.nix` to `inputs` (see above).
# ...

# In `outputs`:

  nixosConfigurations.yourSystem = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {

    # ...

    services.nsd = {
      enable = true;
      zones = {
        "example.com" = {
          # provideXFR = [ ... ];
          # notify = [ ... ];
          data = dns.lib.toString "example.com" (import ./example.com.nix { inherit dns; });
        };
      };
    };

  };

}
```

If your system configuration is not a flake, everything will be essentially
the same, you will just import it differently.


### In modules you develop

`dns.lib` provides the `types` attribute, which contains DNS-related
types to be used in the NixOS module system. Using them you can define
an option in your module such as this one:

```nix
# dns = ...

{

yourModule = {
  options = {
    # <...>

    zones = lib.mkOption {
      type = lib.types.attrsOf dns.lib.types.zone;
      description = "DNS zones";
    };
  };

  config = {
    # You can call `toString` on a zone from the `zones` attrset and get
    # a string suitable, for example, for writing with `writeTextFile`.
  };
};

}
```

As another example, take a look at the `evalZone` function in `dns/default.nix`,
which takes a name for a zone and a zone definition, defines a “fake” module
similar to the one above, and then evaluates it.

`dns.utils` provides `writeZone`, which is a helper function that additionally
calls `toString` and writes the resulting string to a file.
